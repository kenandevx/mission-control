# Changelog

All notable changes to Mission Control are documented here.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Status colors**: `queued` events now display grey (waiting) instead of blue. Blue is reserved exclusively for actively `running` events. Previously, events waiting in the cron queue appeared blue, causing confusion with actively executing events.

### Added
- **Event detail modal**: Added "Created At" card showing when the event was first created
- **Event detail modal**: Added "Model" card showing the model override or "Agent default"
- **Event detail modal**: Added dedicated "Status" card showing current occurrence status prominently
- **Status Guide popup**: Added missing status entries: `auto_retry`, `force_retry`, `stale_recovery`
- **Status Guide popup**: Redesigned with lifecycle grouping, colored dots, and richer descriptions

### Changed
- **README**: Complete rewrite — agent-friendly file map, corrected color guide, flowcharts, API reference
- **Status Guide**: Updated `queued` description to clarify it means "cron assigned, waiting to fire" (grey, not blue)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Calendar event colors: `run_started_at`/`run_finished_at` now included in all event queries
- Cron job creation: Scheduler now uses `--at 30s` for past timestamps instead of failing

### Added
- Artifact files: Download and inline preview in Output tab
- Process simulation: Dry-run mode with SSE streaming

### Changed
- Execution engine: Migrated from BullMQ/Redis to OpenClaw native cron engine
- No Redis dependency
